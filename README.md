# Minerva

Minerva is an open-source scanning tool designed to help developers identify security vulnerabilities, potential immprovements, and valuable insights within their code and applications. Named after the Roman goddess of wisdom, Minerva is designed to help developers quickly identify and address security vulnerabilities and other issues within their codebase.

## Key Features

- **Security Scanning**: Minerva scans your web applications for security vulnerabilities, including scanning scripts, stylesheets, and other files for potential security issues.
- **Minimalist Interface**: Since Minerva is designed to be a lightweight tool, it only provides a API for scanning and retrieving results. This allows developers to integrate Minerva into their existing workflows and tools.
- **Information Gathering**: Minerva can also be used to gather information about your codebase, including identifying network, dependencies, and other information.

## Prerequisites
